- The challenge description tells us there is a user named *tim3zapper* and he wants us to find the email id of a photographer.
- tim3zapper > twitter profile. Going over his tweets, we observe that one of the tweets were deleted but backed up somewhere > Guesswork > internet archive
- Web Archives > a user mentioned `@sullyth3h4x0r`.

- Sherlock tool > Info based on ello page with this username [https://ello.co/sullyth3h4x0r](https://). In the page, we see a picture of the plane and a caption > to find the photographer

- Now we know that the mail id in the flag corresponds to the photographer who took this photo
